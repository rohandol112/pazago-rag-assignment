# 🐳 Docker Configuration Info

## ✅ Current Status: WORKING & DEPLOYED

The current `Dockerfile` in this directory is the **optimized production version** that Render is using to run your live backend.

### 🔧 Key Optimizations Included:
- ✅ `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (resolves dependency conflicts)
- ✅ `.npmrc` configuration for consistent builds
- ✅ Non-root user security (`mastra:nodejs`)
- ✅ Production cleanup with `npm prune`
- ✅ Multi-stage-like optimization

### 🚀 Deployment Status:
- **Live URL**: https://pazago-rag-assignment-1.onrender.com
- **Platform**: Render (automatic Docker builds)
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed and running

### 📝 Note:
This is the **final optimized version**. The `Dockerfile.optimized` that was removed was just a duplicate. The current `Dockerfile` contains all necessary optimizations and is production-ready.

**No action needed - your deployment is working perfectly!**
